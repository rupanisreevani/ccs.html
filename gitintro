Great question 👍 Let’s go step by step.

🔹 What is Git?

Git is a version control system used by developers to track changes in their code.

It helps you:

Keep history of your code (who changed what & when).

Collaborate with others easily.

Roll back to an earlier version if something goes wrong.



👉 Think of it as a time machine for your code.


---

🔹 What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud platform where you can store your Git repositories online.

It provides:

Remote storage for your Git projects.

Collaboration with teammates (pull requests, issues, discussions).

A community to share open-source projects.



👉 Git = Tool
👉 GitHub = Hosting service for Git repositories

🔹 Install GitHub (Actually Git)

> GitHub itself is a website, you don’t install GitHub. You install Git on your computer, and then use GitHub as the online remote repository.



✅ Step 1: Install Git

Windows

1. Go to: https://git-scm.com/downloads


2. Download and install Git.


3. During installation, keep default options.



Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

MacOS

brew install git



---

✅ Step 2: Check Installation

Open Command Prompt / Terminal and type:

git --version

You should see something like:

git version 2.xx.x


---

🔹 Login to GitHub

Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to https://github.com/.


2. Click Sign up.


3. Enter email → password → username → verify → finish signup.




---

Step 2: Configure Git with Your GitHub Account

Run these commands in terminal (replace with your GitHub email & name):

git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"


---

Step 3: Authenticate (Login)

Two ways:

1. Using HTTPS + Personal Access Token (PAT) (Recommended)

Generate a token:
Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic) → Generate new token.

Use it instead of password when pushing code.



2. Using SSH Keys (Advanced, for frequent usage)

Generate SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your@email.com"

Add key to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys.






✅ Now you can clone, push, and pull repositories from GitHub!
